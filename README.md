This project is something I consider to create for around 15 years.

The idea is to create a browser-based real-time game, with the only caveat that game speed will be scaled so a player can make a certain amount of turns per day (or per hour). The player will be able to play single as well as multiplayer games. The game is planned to be medieval time themed.

The game still does not have a name, the temporary working name is "Elite War Game" (similar to my existing game: VFM Elita http://vfm-elita.com).

The source code is public and planned to remain this way. Please feel free to contribute if you choose so, just consider I'm not a professional developer (anymore), my coding skills might be rusty and used technologies are "in learning" mode. So I accept pull-requests with good comments and suggestions.

Thanks, everyone!
